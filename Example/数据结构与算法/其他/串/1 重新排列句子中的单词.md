                words.append(text[wordStart: i])
                wordStart = i + 1
        words.append(text[wordStart: i + 1])

        words = sorted(words, key=lambda x: len(x))

        ans = ""
        for i, word in enumerate(words):
            if i != len(words) - 1:
                ans += word + " "
